<p id="394282f2-b60f-4ffb-af18-b807b8fb52f4" class="">we rang in the new the year in santa cruz with some good
    friends before hustling back down to pasadena to finish furnishing and settling into our new apartment. we
    perused craigslist constantly and drove all over east la to pick up our finds. we settled in the best way we
    know, by joining a gym, restarting swing dancing classes and having our friends over for as many dinner
    parties as possible.</p>
<p id="b3408f3d-e234-4439-a20f-5e455057ebb6" class="">in january, cam went on a girls’ trip to maui with some of
    her oldest friends. they had a wonderful time reconnecting on the beach and in the pool after years without
    much time together. we vowed to do it again soon and the plotting for the next girls’ trip has already
    begun.</p>
<p id="806b2f47-ea78-4165-a21d-15d5b7825954" class="">other highlights from the end of winter included traveling
    up to the central coast to attend the bedford mushroom festival, al taking our nephew nathan to the
    huntington gardens and cam finishing paying off her student loans!</p>
<p id="fdc84627-2b5e-4c01-b2f5-832fc28e6fd9" class="">in the spring, we ramped up our wedding planning efforts
    with rental mockups, wine tastings and lots of detail planning. we did have a break in wedding planning to
    have our combo bachelor/bachelorette/camille’s birthday party in las vegas, which was an absolute blast! we
    explored <a href="https://meowwolf.com/visit/las-vegas">omega mart</a> (an immersive art exhibit), then the
    boys played poker while the girls had a nap before we all went dancing together. shortly after that, we
    started babysitting our niblings much more as jason needed to go to the east coast for some job training. it
    was bittersweet to see him go, and we were ready to be there for karla, nathan &amp; talia.</p>
<p id="25b39564-5729-4109-a0bd-36899996f611" class="">at the end of april, we took a trip up to aromas to attend
    a friend’s beautiful wedding and spent most of the rest of the month hunkering down to finish up planning
    our own wedding!</p>
<p id="edbc9ffb-4ca7-49a4-91e1-d96357e7673f" class="">a week before the wedding, we headed down to san diego
    with an absolutely stuffed car to wrap up our last planning tasks, do our beauty appointments and greet our
    friends and families as they arrived for the celebration.</p>
<p id="c42a6402-0915-4b85-b455-1811304b22ae" class="">to camille, the wedding weekend really began at her henna
    appointment on thursday evening. she sat still for four hours in the house rented by her family to get her
    hands and feet decorated. on friday afternoon we went to the house we had rented for the wedding party to
    greet our friends as they arrived. in the evening, we hosted a welcome dinner and henna party for our
    wedding party and close family. we spent the next afternoon at a nearby brewery for the welcome event.
    camille’s friend rei was able to get a delicious, beautiful wedding cake off of buy nothing, so we cut the
    cake and drank some beer. right after the welcome event we shuttled the wedding party up to the top of mount
    soledad for the rehearsal dinner at our favorite thai restaurant from when we lived nearby. robin, rei,
    crystal and jay, maia and eve all gave beautiful speeches. </p>
<p id="7afe46b6-1c6a-4d95-8297-411ade3d14ff" class="">the wedding day started bright and early when our hair
    stylists and makeup artist arrived. we spent the morning getting all glammed up and excited for the wedding
    day. most everything ran smoothly, except for a snafu with transportation and some missing blackberry
    liqueur. we took our wedding portraits at the house and then headed to the venue! we had an absolutely
    fabulous time celebrating and dancing with our friends and family. one of our favorite parts was the
    speeches given by our wedding party: adam, bri, sam and jason.</p>
<p id="cecbab52-84b4-4983-8998-296a60a7f033" class="">right after the wedding, we were off on our honeymoon in
    playa del carmen, mexico. unfortunately, we spent the first four days of our trip sick (no, it was not
    covid, although we did both come down with that during 2022). lucky for us, we had taken extra time for our
    honeymoon, so we still had a decent amount of time to relax and explore. in playa, we lounged on beach
    chairs with drinks, swam in cool cenotes, explored mayan ruins, and ate many, many tacos. we spent the last
    few days of our trip on cozumel at the lovely hotel b. there, we snorkeled over the reefs and bummed around
    our accommodations infinity pool.</p>
<p id="b3501871-e122-49e6-913d-0b6dbeb82cbd" class="">we spent much of the summer with our friends and family,
    enjoying la and enjoying leaving la. we had friends over for pool parties and helped karla do swim lessons
    with nathan and talia. al took a few trips to google offices in la and sf, where he got to meet some
    collaborators for the first time. on a trip to sf, he spent quality time with friends, including a fun hike
    on angel island. at the same time, rei joined cam at palomino – a country music festival at the rose
    bowl.</p>
<p id="a3eb1cee-1d7c-471c-98d6-45489b6a11f9" class="">in july, we got the chance to attend our beautiful
    friends’ beautiful wedding in sandpoint, idaho. we worked remotely for about a week from sandpoint. other
    than the wedding, we hiked, biked, and ate the best fried potatoes of our lives. karla, nathan and talia
    followed jason out to the east coast and left their wonderful cat houdini in our care until they got
    settled.</p>
<p id="f00134eb-d3b2-48c7-b923-a84f82f0797e" class="">in august, we took a couple of trips to san diego to
    celebrate al’s grandpa’s 96th birthday with the family, and to say goodbye to friends who moved to seattle.
    al look a trip to boulder, colorado to meet up with coworkers from his sister team over a craft beer. we
    also took a trip to attend aromas day, which crystal and jay were very involved in planning. on the way up,
    al gave me my birthday present, which was a two-night stay at the swiss belle room in the madonna inn in san
    luis obispo. we explored our old stomping grounds and ate their delicious pink champagne cake for
    breakfast.</p>
<p id="20ef502a-24ea-43ce-8cd7-18aec65db3a0" class="">we began the fall with another trip to san diego for cam’s
    company offsite and a friend’s dance performance. al got covid and spent a couple of weeks recovering before
    we got back on our feet. </p>
<p id="5e53f782-b424-43d6-9ea3-9519c9eb7738" class="">at the end of september we traveled to the east coast,
    partially for al to meet with coworkers in new york and partially to deliver houdini back to his people in
    baltimore. we packed in the fun on this trip, touristing in baltimore, attending broadway shows (some good,
    some bad), celebrating al’s 30th birthday with friends and watching a jazz show at birdland.</p>
<p id="46092c95-f9c7-4e83-9b07-e8a3835c669f" class="">we were home for only a couple of days before jetting up
    to san francisco for camille to attend a conference, then jetting back down for al’s birthday party in la.
    we had it at the vintage synthesizer museum, followed by dinner and drinks. since we knew we’d be moving at
    the end of the month, we packed in the la fun. we went to a talk on the history of pasadena, attended the
    huntington garden’s halloween party and saw a showing of nosferatu at a historical theater with a live
    score. we celebrated halloween weekend with our friends and then they helped us pack up our apartment.</p>
<p id="88699eaa-ad46-4422-a2b5-f2b1f1c3aa24" class="">on november 3 we loaded the moving truck and drove from
    pasadena back to aromas, where we just dropped off our things before heading out to the east coast
    again.</p>
<p id="f11c3fdf-1f6c-4a71-8d2b-a73fd281f6e6" class="">we started our trip in new york, where al presented at the
    pydata conference and celebrated our 10th (dating) anniversary. we took the train down to philadelphia,
    where some highlights included a tour of liberty hall, great vintage shopping and a visit to the
    philadelphia magic gardens, a beautiful mosaic art environment. after that we headed to dc for a couple of
    great days of museums and a tour of the capitol on a rainy day. in dc we picked up our rental car and drove
    out to culpeper, virginia, in the hills below the blue ridge mountains. we spent our time hiking in
    shenandoah national park, discussing “digital minimalism” by cal newport, and going both whiskey and wine
    tasting.</p>
<p id="ce3ad64b-cf69-4ceb-a911-c7dd4f13db81" class="">after that we drove to baltimore. we spent time with
    jason, karla and the kids, and crystal and jay joined us all to celebrate thanksgiving at karla’s brother’s
    house. the gathering was huge, loving and delicious, we had a lovely time.</p>
<p id="f5758585-353e-43f1-8ad9-6b1e89b2f118" class="">we’ve tried to lay low for the month of december, which
    for us means only two trips. al had a work trip to mountain view, on which camille tagged along and met up
    with her team in oakland. we spent a lot of time moving things into our storage unit and getting our space
    in aromas set up. we had a gorgeous (but very small) christmas in yosemite and rang in the new year with
    some very old friends in joshua tree national park.</p>
